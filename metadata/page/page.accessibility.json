For example, that means you should be able to:\r\n \r\n- change colours, contrast levels and fonts\r\n- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen\r\n- navigate the form using just a keyboard\r\n- navigate the form using speech recognition software\r\n- listen to the form using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)\r\n \r\nWe’ve also made the text as simple as possible to understand.\r\n \r\n[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.\r\n\r\n## About the accessibility of this online form\r\n \r\nWe are in the process of arranging a full WCAG 2.1 audit for this online form. \r\n\r\nWe will update this statement once we’ve received the WCAG 2.1 audit report.

The [Design System accessibility](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/) guide explains the current state of accessibility for these components. \r\n\r\nWe have extended the functionality of one of the components provided by the GOV.UK Design System. The ‘add another’ component, on the upload page, is a new component. It hasn’t been thoroughly tested yet, but will be tested when this service goes to audit.  \r\n\r\n## What to do if you can’t access part of this form\r\n\r\nIf you need information on this website in a different format, you can request support in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- email [cff@sscl.gse.gov.uk](mailto:cff@sscl.gse.gov.uk) \r\n- call 0808 196 1759\r\n- if you’re outside the UK, call +44 1633 630904\r\n\r\nThe opening times for the SSCL helpline are:\r\n\r\nMonday to Friday: 8am to 6pm\r\nClosed on bank holidays.\r\n\r\n## Reporting accessibility problems \r\n \r\nWe’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this online form.\r\n \r\nIf you find any problems that aren’t listed on this page or think we’re not meeting the requirements of the accessibility regulations, contact: [claim.for.costs.of.a.childs.funeral@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:claim.for.costs.of.a.childs.funeral@digital.justice.gov.uk) giving details of the issue and any assistive technology you are using.\r\n\r\n## Enforcement procedure\r\n \r\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations.
